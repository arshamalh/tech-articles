Have you ever wondered how you can remove redundant build dependencies from your docker image?

Did you know your image can be easily optimized?

> We're not much language-related in this article, and reading all examples can be beneficial.

## TS example

For example, maybe you've always been using this kind of Dockerfile to build and run your Typescript project:

```apache
FROM node:18-alpine3.15
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install --include=dev
COPY tsconfig.json .
COPY src src
RUN ["npm", "run", "build"]
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

Simple, but it can be smaller without losing anything important, Because, on the line

```apache
RUN ["npm", "run", "build"]
```

We are converting some TS codes to JS codes with some Tools (dev dependencies) What happens if we remove those tools after conversion? Nothing!

Have a look at the picture below, we've built our image in three stages, instead of one, and we saved 35% of space!

![optimizing docker builds with multistage builds](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o4htns2axmh87lieoclw.png align="left")

With the code below:

```apache
FROM node:18-alpine3.15 as ts-compiler
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package*.json ./
COPY tsconfig.json ./
RUN npm install --include=dev
COPY src src
# Build the project (TS to JS conversion)
RUN ["npm", "run", "build"]

FROM node:18-alpine3.15 as ts-remover
WORKDIR /usr/app
# We need package.json again
COPY --from=ts-compiler /usr/app/package*.json ./
# Move built codes from last stage here
COPY --from=ts-compiler /usr/app/build ./
# We don't need dev dependencies anymore
RUN npm install --omit=dev

# Using google optimized containers can make it even smaller
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:18
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY --from=ts-remover /usr/app ./
USER 1000
CMD ["index.js"]
```

## Be careful about environment variables

Imagine you are using a special package, for example, `Puppeteer`, Puppeteer will download a chrome browser when you're installing it, but you can disable it if you want, by setting an ENV. Have a look at the change we made on stage one of the last code:

```apache
FROM node:18-alpine3.15 as ts-compiler
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package.json .

# This line is added üëáüèª
ENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true

RUN npm install --include=dev
COPY tsconfig.json .
COPY src src
RUN ["npm", "run", "build"]
```

So if you run the multistage build again, you'll see a huge increment üò≥

![Increment after multistage](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kx980s9lt79fuob150vl.png align="left")

What is happening? The fact is, you should use ENV and ARG commands **per Stage**, we are installing dependencies twice in two stages, so we should skip chrome installation twice! Nothing talks more than a piece of code üòÑ:

```apache
FROM node:18-alpine3.15 as ts-compiler
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package.json .

# Define ENV once here
ENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
RUN npm install --include=dev
COPY tsconfig.json .
COPY src src
RUN ["npm", "run", "build"]

FROM node:18-alpine3.15 as ts-remover
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY --from=ts-compiler /usr/app/package.json .
COPY --from=ts-compiler /usr/app/build .

# Define ENV once again!
ENV PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
RUN npm install --omit=dev

# We don't need that ENV in this stage, 
# because we're not installing anything more.
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:18
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY --from=ts-remover /usr/app ./
USER 1000
CMD ["index.js"]
```

## Go Example

Go containers (and any other compile language) can be optimized even more. (much more üòÑ) Because their runtime is tied to them, you don't need a runtime like NodeJS applications do, so, you can drop the compiler itself in the second stage and just use a binary executable.

```apache
FROM golang:1.18-alpine3.15 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
# Copy go.mod and go.sum first, because of caching reasons.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . ./
# Compile project
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -o main .

# Use another clean image without Golang compiler.
FROM alpine:3.15 AS production
COPY --from=builder /app/main .
CMD ["./main"]
```

It's right! we saved about 96% of our space! The first result is without the multistage technique, Second is using alpine-3.15 as production. Third is using [gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11](http://gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11) which is the smallest image out there.

## Including UI

You can even add a UI to your Dockerfile in another stage! In this case, I have a Svelte SPA project beside my project (in ui folder) and I'm serving it from Go Backend.

```apache
FROM golang:1.18-alpine3.15 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . ./
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -o main .

# This stage convert svelte project to vanilla HTML, CSS, JS.
FROM node:18-alpine3.15 AS frontend
WORKDIR /ui
COPY ui .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

FROM alpine:3.15 AS production
COPY --from=builder /app/main .
COPY --from=frontend /ui/public /ui
CMD ["./main"]
```
